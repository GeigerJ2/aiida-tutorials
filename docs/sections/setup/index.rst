Configuration
=============

.. rst-class:: header-text

    AiiDA is a powerful that consists of many components.
    Here we offer short modules that explain how to configure AiiDA and its components.

.. rst-class:: center-panel

    .. panels::
        :body: bg-light
        :header: panel-header-text
        :footer: bg-light border-0

        ------
        :column: col-lg-12

        .. link-button:: profile
            :type: ref
            :text: Profile
            :classes: btn-light text-left stretched-link font-weight-bold
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The first step to configuring AiiDA is setting up your profile.
        In this module we have a look at both the easy configuration using ``quicksetup``, as well as the manual version ``verdi setup``.

        :type: ref
        :text: Codes

    Codes are the basic building blocks of our workflows, and need to be configured on a computer.
